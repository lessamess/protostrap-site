        Modern prototypes simulate the real thing as closely as possible. This means that they have to display and work with realistic data, often in great quantities. Getting the data into the prototype as easily as possible is a key aspect of prototyping. <br>
        <br>
        Protostrap allows you to build prototypes with flexible data that is easy to manage. Designers should not have to manage databases. They should be able to provide data in a way that is as easy to learn as possible.
        Users should also be alter data when using the prototype and the prototype's data should be resettable easily.
        <h4>Data sources</h4>
        Protostrap has different ways to get data into the Prototype;
        <ul class="simpleList">
            <li>Using simple textfiles</li>
            <li>Using Google Spreadsheets</li>
            <li>By importing CSV files</li>
        </ul>
