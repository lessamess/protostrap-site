            <li>Unzip it. <br>This will give you a folder called <b>Protostrap-master</b></li>
            <li>You can rename it something that makes more sense for you. For example the name of a project.</li>
            <li>
                Move the folder inside the MAMP "htdocs" folder which is located in the MAMP Application directory /Applications/MAMP. This folder is called "Document Root". (You can change the path for the Document Root in the MAMP application's Preferences Panel)

            <li>
                You're done! You can access Protostrap in the browser via: <a href="http://localhost/protostrap">http://localhost/protostrap</a><br>(assuming you have named the folder protostrap.)
