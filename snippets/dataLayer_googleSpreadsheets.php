        Google spreadsheets have proven to be a very convenient way to get data into the prototypes, especially large amounts of data. Google spreadsheets are simple to use and can also be shared with customers to make them add data they would like to seee in the prototype.

        <a id="structure"></a>
        <h4 class="sub">The structure of the spreadsheets</h4>
        The spreadsheets' structure has to follow these simple rules:
        <ul class="simpleList">
             <li>The first row containes the names of the columns. These names are turned into keys for the array. <br>
                Make sure the first row is not empty. You might also want to freeze the first row in the spreadsheet through <b>View</b> > <b>Freeze</b> > <b>1 row</b>
            </li>
            <li>Make sure the column names are unique.</li>
            <li>The cells must contain only plain data. No functions or similar</li>
            <li>Do not have completely empty columns (columns with a name but no data are fine) </li>
            <li>Do not format the cells. You can if you want, but no formatting will be taken over by Protostrap</li>
         </ul>
