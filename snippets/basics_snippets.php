        Snippets are Protostrap's way to make specific parts of your project reusable, for example your project's header or footer. <br>This reduces redundancy and the amount of work needed to change something that appears on several pages.
        <br><br>
        This is done by saving the code of the snippet to a separate file into the directory <b>snippets</b>. <br><br>

        The snippet can then be included into the page by using this function:<br><br>
        <pre><code class="php">// This includes the contents of the file
// snippets/footer.php
&lt;?php include("./snippets/footer.php");?></code></pre>
